Video ids and thumbnails
=============================
2015-09-28



The php functions I use to get the video ids and thumbnails from youtube, vimeo and dailymotion.


The functions are in the [function.video.php]( https://github.com/lingtalfi/video-ids-and-thumbnails/blob/master/function.video.php ) file.
Just copy paste the one you need.



I also wrote some pre-tests to showcase the functions. 
Those pre-tests are in the [testvideo.php]( https://github.com/lingtalfi/video-ids-and-thumbnails/blob/master/testvideo.php ) file.
