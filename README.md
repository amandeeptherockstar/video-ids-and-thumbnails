Video ids and thumbnails
=============================
2015-09-28



The php functions I use to get the video ids and thumbnails from youtube, vimeo and dailymotion.

Simply parse the [testvideo.php]( https://github.com/lingtalfi/video-ids-and-thumbnails/blob/master/testvideo.php ) file, everything is in there.
